          <p>Please allow 5-­7 business days from when the item is delivered for your returned order to be processed. You will be notified via email at the email address listed on your account when your order was placed. Please note that your banking institution may require additional time to process and post this transaction to your account once they have received the information from us (typically 3-­5 business days).

                We can only issue a refund to the original form of payment used at the point of purchase. In the event you no longer have access to this account or it is no longer active, we will then process your refund in the form of a check mailed to the address in your customer profile which can take 4-6 weeks to process. Original shipping charges are nonrefundable.</p>

            <div class="column2">
              <p>Rapid advances in technology have allowed for the development of sophisticated scanning machines and recording techniques that can be used to safely study human volunteers.

                    Brain imaging machines that can ‘see’ inside the brain can be used to monitor the progression and treatment of brain disease.  They can help researchers understand the causes by comparing with healthy volunteers.
                    
                    An innovative technique called microdosing can also be used in volunteers to measure how very small doses of potential new drugs behave in the human body. These microdoses are radio-labelled, injected into human volunteers and measured (usually in blood samples) using a very sensitive measuring device called an accelerator mass spectrometer.
                    
                    Less high-tech studies for nutrition, drug addiction and pain can also be carried out on consenting humans in the interest of advancing medical science. These studies can help replace animal tests.</p>
